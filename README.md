# Employees Attendance
  
In this project, I aimed to use both of local storage and cookies.  
This project is a company website simulator that let you add the employees' data and lets each employee add his own attendance by ID.  
The first part of the project which is adding employees' data uses local storage, while the second part of the project which is adding employees' attendance uses cookies.  
  
The challenge was to use the cookies correctly to store and restore data from them.
